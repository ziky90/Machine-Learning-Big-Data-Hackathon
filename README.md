Machine-Learning-Big-Data-Hackathon
===================================

Script coded at the Big Data Machine Learning hackathon.

In the script I have tryied several Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms to be able to predict the prices from sentimenr from tweets.

Preformance of the classifiers was not that good at the end and it might be better to use some time series, or statistical methods approaches.
